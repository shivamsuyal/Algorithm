#Find The Freeloader
#The Story Goes Something Like ...
Today is the opening ceremony of your brand new sweet shop and you have planned to give free sweets to your first 100,000 customers who had pre-registered for the free sweet (you are very rich you don't care about money so yeah you can do that )
So,now you have the list of 100,000 people to whom ypu have to give free sweets.
As you were reading the list one of your shop member warned you about the freeloader.
You don't know about the freeloader so he started his story.

#The Freeloader
We don't know his name so we call him freeloader.
The freeloader is a dangerous man he goes to place where free things are been given when he receives his free gift and then comes back with a different name to take the free gift again.

#Freeloader Strategy
When he comes back again to receive the free gift he changes his name in a different manner.
He randomly choose two people from the line and joins their name and use it as his name.

#Challenge
Hearing about the freeloader you got scared and you came up with an idea to find the freeloader in the list.
You are good at programming so you thought of making a program that could find the freeloader.

The opening ceremony is going to start anytime soon so you don't have any time to spare.
    1.Computational time => 20 seconds
    2.Total people in the list => 100,000

Eg.
    Random person 1 name = David
    Random person 2 name = Andrew
    So the name of freeloader will be = DavidAndrew
